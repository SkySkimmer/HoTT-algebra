I ended up having trouble using the bundled and canonical structure based algebraic hierarchy of this project, so I ported some of [MathClasses](http://math-classes.github.io/)'s unbundled and typeclass based to HoTT in [HoTTClasses](github.com/SkySkimmer/HoTTClasses/). You should probably use that.

The following projects also have some form of Homotopy Type Theory and algebra:
- [UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/) (not based on [HoTT](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/), not higher inductive types).
- [Lean2](https://github.com/leanprover/lean2/) (alternative theorem prover to Coq).
- possibly others, especially since I don't plan to update this README.
